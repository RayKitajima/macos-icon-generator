## FAQ

### Why npx?

This package is meant to be used as a one-off script. It's not meant to be installed as a dependency. Using npx allows you to run the script without installing it. If you want to install it, you can do so with `npm install -g macos-icon-generator`. Then you can run it with `macos-icon-generator <path-to-image>`. Also npx fetches the latest version of the package.

### How can I generate icons for iOS?

Starting with Xcode 14, you don't need to generate separate icons for iOS. Just choose the Single Size option in the app iconâ€™s Attributes inspector in the asset catalog.
